title: "Tech support through Civic Tech 911"
---

Civic Tech 911 is our pro-bono tech support programme for NGOs. Through
this programme we aim to help NGOs for free with any technical need they
may have if our capacity allows it. The Civic Tech 911 support team is
here to help you with any issues you may encounter with using Website
Factory at maximum capacity.

Civic Tech 911 works like an online scheduling system. How to access it:

1)  In the dashboard area there is an “Help” section
2)  Search through the information already available.
3)  If you cannot find the answer then scroll to the end of the list and
    press ”Civic Tech 911” and you will be redirected to the programme
    page
4)  Book a meeting and mention some details about the issue you are
    faced with.
5)  You will be contacted to confirm your appointment by our colleagues
    as soon as possible

### What type of help is not supported through Civic Tech 911

This programme does not cover very specific customisation needs and does
not ensure extra development for individual websites. If you need a new
feature that Website Factory does not have yet, then the team will
evaluate if this is a need more NGOs also have and if it will be useful
in the long run for everyone using the platform. If so, this feature
will enter development.
