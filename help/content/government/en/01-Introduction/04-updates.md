From time to time, to make sure the solution works well and that you
have the latest version available we will be running a few maintenance
checks, pro-bono. These maintenance checks consist of:

1)  Updating the code that Website Factory is built on
2)  Security updates that are necessary to keep you safe from cyberthreats
3)  Adding new modules or functionalities to the app
