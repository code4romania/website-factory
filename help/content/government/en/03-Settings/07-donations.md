---

It is important for an organisation to correctly and efficiently manage
their supporters' donations. In Website Factory: NGO you can set up the
thank you page for donors, a recommended amount for donations and you
can quickly integrate the EuPlﾄフesc and Netopia payment processors (this
step implies the existence of a signed contract with one or both payment
processors).

To set the thank you page that donors see after concluding a payment, it
is necessary to go through the following steps:

1)  Access the admin panel
2)  Select the secondary settings menu from the top right corner
3)  Select **"Settings"**
4)  Select "Donations" from the secondary menu, which is found under the
    menu in the platform's header.
5)  Access the **"Thank you page"** field
6)  Select from the pages already created the one you want the user to
    see when they conclude a donation. If the page does not exist, you
    can create it. You can find information about creating pages in
    the Help section of the Content Guide.
7)  Click **"Save"**

To set a preset value for donation that you recommend to your donors, it
is necessary to go through the following steps:

1)  Access the admin panel
2)  Select the secondary settings menu from the top right corner
3)  Select "**Settings**"
4)  Select "**Donations**" from the secondary menu, which is found under
    the menu in the platform's header.
5)  Click on the "**Add**" button from the "**Preset values**" field.
6)  Input the preset value in the numeric field or select a value with
    the help of the arrows.
