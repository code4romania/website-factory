To add a new user:

1)  Access dashboard
2)  Select the secondary menu in the upper right corner, marked as a hexagon
3)  Select **Users**
4)  Press **Add**
5)  Fill in the userâ€™s name, email, assign a role and set the primary
    language of this user
6)  Press **Save**

The new user will receive an email with a link to set his own password
and instructions to access the admin dashboard. We recommend you grant
access to users through their official email addresses and not personal
accounts.
