title: "What does each user role mean"
---

The roles you can assign a new user are:

1)  **Administrator** - an administrator will have all the permissions
    that you have in the admin dashboard, which means also the
    capacity to delete your account as well.
2)  **Editor** - an editor may intervene to add, edit or delete content
    all through the website as well as create forms and have access to
    all the sections of the website. An editor cannot change the
    website settings or user accounts.
