As an administrator you have the right to edit every user. In order to
change the role, email or language of a user you have to:

1)  Access dashboard
2)  Select the secondary menu in the upper right corner, marked as a hexagon
3)  Select **Users**
4)  Click on the name of the user you want to edit
5)  Edit the information
6)  Press **Save**

If you choose to change the email address of the user, this user will no
longer be able to log in with his previous email address. An email to
set his password will be sent to the new email address and the user will
have to go through the setup process again.
