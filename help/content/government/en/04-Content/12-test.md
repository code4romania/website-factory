### Test the adaptability on all devices

If you finished building your website, before launching it, check if the
content fits well on all types of devices. For this, access your
website’s URL from a laptop, on all available browsers, a tablet and at
least a mobile device with Android or iOS. Check every page of your
website, the donation page, the contact page and test all the forms, if
you have any.

### Test any integration with third party systems

When you create pages, it is important to set up the metadata area also.
The metadata area is found in the first part of the page, in the editing
mode. There you have to fill in the page’s title, a short description
and an image. These information will be displayed when the page is
shared on social media, for example. Check on social media if all the
elements are correctly displayed.

Check the integration with the payment processor services. Try to make a
donation with Netopia, EuPlatesc or PayPal and test if everything works
fine from the beginning to the thank you page.

If you added a tracking code from Google Analytic to measure the website
traffic, then check if the data is correctly transmitted and if Google
Analytics registers all the visits.

If you have additional integrations which are not part of Website
Factory: ONG, then check if these are completely functional before the
public launching of the website.

### Check all the content

Before the launch, check again all the content to avoid the
misspellings, inappropriate photos or double content. Here is a
checklist for a minimal verification:

- Is the whole content on the website?
- Are the translations correctly added on the whole website?
- Have all the pages title and descriptions added in the admin?
- Are all the images correctly displayed?
- Are the forms tested and functional?
- Are all the button links correct?
- Are the header and footer menu correctly configured?
