title: "Recommendations for a well-organised content"
---

Now everything is in place, and your Website Factory: NGO instance is
ready so you can add the content of your website. In order to create a
coherent and well-structured website, we have few recommendations for
you.

Write down all the information you need to display on your website and
then group the information into categories. You could start with two
content categories: narrative content and utilitarian content.

**The narrative content** is the content about: organization’s mission,
projects, blog, annual reports, testimonials from beneficiaries,
information about our partners, sponsors or any other things that are
directly connected to the activity of the organization.

**The utilitarian content** is the content about: organization’s team,
Articles of Incorporation of the association, donations pages, Terms and
conditions, Privacy Policy, Contact page and other useful information.

After you have listed all the content ideas, create a structure. A
content structure should look like this:

#### Header Menu:
- Home Page
- About Us
  - Page about the organization’s mission
  - How we work
  - Official documents of organization
  - Our team
  - Code of Conduct
