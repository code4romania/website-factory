title: "How to integrate other services such as Google Analytics or Facebook Pixel?"
---

It is recommended that you integrate your website with other useful
services such as Google Analytics to monitor traffic on your website,
Mailchimp or another email marketing tool, Facebook Pixel for monitoring
ads campaigns etc. All of these tools offer a custom code that has to be
integrated in your website.

To integrate the **HTML code** of a third party service, you have to:

1)  Go to the admin dashboard of the tool you want to integrate and find
    the HTML code you need and copy it.
2)  Access the website dashboard.
3)  Select the secondary menu in the upper right corner, shaped like a hexagon
4)  Select **Settings**
5)  Go to the last section of this page: **Custom HTML**
6)  Paste the HTMl code either in the head or body area depending on the
    instructions the third party software indicated
7)  Press **Save**

    Important: In case the HTML code contains errors or it is not copied
    correctly it is possible that the whole website is no longer displayed.
    If so, please remove the code and save the Settings page again.
