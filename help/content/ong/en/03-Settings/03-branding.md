title: "How to set up the main color of the website and the logo?"
---

This section is dedicated to your branding settings: main color and
logo. Setting up the main color is important because the visual elements
all throughout the website depend on it (icons, separators, boxes etc).
These elements borrow the main color and set it up in different
intensities and tonalities to ensure visual consistency to the website.
We recommend you choose a color that is not very dim or light as
contrast might not be optimal all the time. Go for more intense of
fuller colors for better visuals (for example: blue, red, orange, dark
green, teal, purple etc)

To set the **main color** you have to:

1)  Access dashboard
2)  Select Settings
3)  Click on the colored square next to **Main color**
4)  Select one of the available options or add the color code you want to use.
5)  Press **Save**

**To ensure visual consistency with your identity, we suggest you use a
color that can be found in your logo as well or a color that is
complementary to your logo.**

To add your **logo** you have to:

1)  Access dashboard
2)  Select the secondary menu in the upper right corner, shaped like a hexagon
3)  Select **Settings**
4)  Press the **Choose file** button in the Logo area
5)  Select the logo from your computer and click upload. We recommend
    you use a file of good quality, png with transparency
6)  Press **Save**

The logo will be uploaded on your website and displayed in the upper
left corner above the menu. It is best that the logo is .png with no
margins. See an example below.
