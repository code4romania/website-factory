Website Factory: ONG is a technical solution that allows you to build
your own websites. This is integrated by default with a series of
functionalities you will need such as online payment tools so you can
collect donations, with tools to monitor traffic such as Google
Analytics, with social networks and a form builder so you can collect
data easily through your website.

Also, the solution also comes equipped with a series of recommendations
to build your content architecture, with page templates to help you
build a complete website such as Terms and Conditions pages or Code of
Conduct model pages.
