In what concerns Website Factory: Schools, 
the support team is here to help you use the solution 
to its fullest extent and to help you build the website you need. 


This support operates through a system of online appointments. You can access it through the following steps:

1)  In the dashboard area there is an “Help” section
2)  Search through the information already available.
3)  If it doesn’t exist, send an email to wf.scoli@code4.ro
5)  You will be contacted to confirm your appointment by our colleagues
    as soon as possible

### What type of support don’t we offer

These appointments do not cover very specific customization needs and 
do not offer additional individual development. 
If you need a new functionality that Website Factory doesn’t have at the moment we receive your message, 
then the team will assess if the internal implementation capacity for this functionality exists 
and if several educational institutions find it useful to be developed and made available to everyone.
