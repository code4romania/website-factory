Website Factory: Schools is provided together with models for a few pages.
Some of these pages are Terms and conditions and Cookie Policy pages.
Having these pages is mandatory for every website especially if you
collect data through forms. If you
already have these pages available feel free to replace the models we
provided with your own. If you do not have them, then customize the
models we proposed and use them accordingly.

In the dashboard in the “Pages” section you will find several templates.

1)  **Terms and conditions** - enter this page and edit all the blank
    spaces or brackets that refer to your organisation or the website
    name or identity. In the section dedicated to collected data types
    make sure you write down all the personal data you might collect
    through the forms on the website. Make sure you add this page to
    the Footer of your website and you set it up in the Settings area
    of the dashboard. Do not forget to translate this page if your
    website is available in more than one language.
2)  **Cookie policy** - enter this page and check the content. This page
    does not need any customisation but it is important that you are
    aware of its contents. This page explains to every user how
    cookies work and how they can disable or enable cookies depending
    on their preferences. Make sure you add this page to the Footer of
    your website and you set it up in the Settings area of the
    dashboard. Do not forget to translate this page if your website is
    available in more than one language.

**Important!**

Website Factory: Schools allows you to create forms
in order for you to gather data. All the data is collected on
the server operated by Code for Romania, where the solution can also be found. 
Every time you build a new form that collect more data than you previously
collected, make sure you:

1)  Add the data types in the second section of the Terms and conditions page
2)  Add a checkbox at the end of your form that asks users to consent to
    your Terms and Conditions.
