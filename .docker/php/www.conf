; The address on which to accept FastCGI requests.
; Valid syntaxes are:

;                            a specific port;

; This value sets the limit on the number of simultaneous requests that will be
; served. Equivalent to the ApacheMaxClients directive with mpm_prefork.
; Equivalent to the PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN environment variable in the original PHP
; CGI. The below defaults are based on a server without much resources. Don't
; forget to tweak pm.* to fit your needs.

; The number of requests each child process should execute before respawning.
